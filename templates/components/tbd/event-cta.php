      <p>
        The Mobile Payments Conference is more than mobile payments, it is an invitation into a growing elite group of professionals
        who are holding a conversation that never ends. The conference is the pivotal intersection between end users, operations, marketing,
        finance and technology where we will discuss and answer all of your questions. We will do more than just talk and present products but walk
        through the experience that helps you personalize the mobile solutions.
