      <h2>The challenge of solving the problem</h2>
      <p>There are differing approaches to help merchants address the problem of payments fraud. Some solutions are
        heavy on machine learning. Some solutions are heavy on rules and manual processes.</p>

          <h5>The Pitfalls of Relying Too Much on Machine Learning</h5>
          <p>Modern fraud prevention solutions need a balanced, comprehensive approach. This approach must address all

          <p>An effective solution needs to not only address these aspects but bring them together as a unified whole—not
